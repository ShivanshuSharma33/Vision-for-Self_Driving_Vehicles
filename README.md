# Vision-for-Self_Driving_Vehicles

This project include training files for the use of Computer Vision algorithm which enables Self Driving Vehicles to identify the path of road and accordingly decide the steering angle, acceleration and braking
system.

<h3>Steps:</h3></br>

1.Collect Data from different sources (e.g Use Udacity Self Driving Car Simulator)</br>
2.Use Training.py and Utlis.py file for traning on collected data to create a Model</br>
3.Use Udacity Self Driving Car Simulator or manually designed Raspberry-Pi vehicle to test the model</br>

<h3>NOTE</h3></br>
To test the Model, one must use the latest test.py file of Self Driving Car Simulator or must write code in accordance of Raspberry-Pi vehicle.
